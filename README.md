## Introduction
A modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, while the modal window is displayed in front of it. This project provides a basic implementation of a modal window with customizable content.

## Features
- Display modal windows with custom content.
- Ability to close modal windows by clicking on a close button or overlay.

## How to Use

2. You'll see buttons labeled "Show modal 1", "Show modal 2", and "Show modal 3".
3. Click on any of these buttons to display the corresponding modal window.
4. Each modal window contains a close button (marked with '√ó') to close it.
5. Click anywhere on the overlay (darkened background) to close the modal window.
